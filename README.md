# My Solutions to Google's Foobar
Foobar is an invite only recruiting initiative by Google that consists of a series of programming challenges. The challenges are split into five levels of increasing difficulty. This repository comprises my solutions to the challenges I recieved. Foobar can be found here: [https://foobar.withgoogle.com](https://foobar.withgoogle.com)

Using python 2.7, these solutions pass all test cases and are written with both readability and performance in mind. I am particularly happy with my solutions to level four's 'Bringing a Gun to a Guard Fight' and 'Distract the Guards' as well as level three's 'Prepare the Bunnie's Escape' and 'Fuel Injection Perfection'.

The challenges I recieved and the solutions I wrote are as follows:
* Level 1
    * Minion Labour Shifts ([problem](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/problems/minion-labour-shifts.md), [solution](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/solutions/minion-labour-shifts.py))
* Level 2
    * Don't Get Volunteered! ([problem](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/problems/dont-get-volunteered.md), [solution](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/solutions/dont-get-volunteered.py))
    * Elevator Maintenance ([problem](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/problems/elevator-maintenance.md), [solution](https://github.com/Calc196/My-Solutions-to-Googles-Foobar/blob/master/solutions/elevator-maintenance.py))
