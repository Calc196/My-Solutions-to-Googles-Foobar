Using python 2.7, these solutions pass all test cases and are written with both readability and performance in mind. I am particularly happy with my solutions to level four's 'Bringing a Gun to a Guard Fight' and 'Distract the Guards' as well as level three's 'Prepare the Bunnie's Escape' and 'Fuel Injection Perfection'.

* Level 1
    * Minion Labour Shifts (problem, solution)
* Level 2
    * Don't Get Volunteered! (problem, solution)
    * Elevator Maintenance (problem, solution)
* Level 3
